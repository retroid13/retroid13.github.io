			<li>Stereo headphone jack</li>
			<li>No backlight</li>

		</ul>
		
		<h3>Accessories</h3>
		
		<p>There is a plethora of accessories for GBA, both official and unofficial and this is very common among any console made by Nintendo.</p>
		
		<h3>Hardware Modifications</h3>
		
		<h5>Backlight 101</h5>
		
		<p>One of the most common and wanted modifications is the backlit mod using the screen from an AGS-101 (the  Gameboy Advance SP). The plastic screen lens can be replaced with glass ones.</p>		

		<h5>GBAccelerator</h5>
		<p><a href="https://division-6.com/products/gbaccelerator/">This</a> mod allows you to change the speed of the GBA to one of four speeds including: normal, fast, ultra and slow-motion by simply simultaneously pressing three GBA buttons. GBAccelerator is useful for quickly bypassing text in games, speeding up games when they experience ‘slowdown’, for slowing down the action in tough games and for custom homemade games made to use the faster processing power that GBAccelerator provides. Chiptune producers will be able to create new, crazy sounds since the audio changes pitch as the speed changes.</p>

		<h5>GBAmp by Anton Veretenenko</h5>
		<p>GBAmp is a little but powerful amplifier module. GBAmp is a "Hi-Fi" grade Class-D amplifier which is more power efficient than Game Boy internal amplifier. This also can help your batteries last longer. Installation method can be found <a href="http://veretenenko.ru/anton/gbamp3/">here</a>.</p>
